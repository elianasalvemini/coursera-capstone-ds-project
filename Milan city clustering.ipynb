    "The problem I would like to analyze arises from a personal need: where should I choose to live?\n",
    "This is the typical problem that a person who has to be relocated for job has to face: in which part of the city should I choose to live? In the next month I have to move for job in a different city from the one I live now and I will deal with the choice of where taking home, in which area of the city. Of course a person could say to choose a place not too far from the office, but this is not enough. I want to explore the neighborhood of the city because I want to find an area where I can practice my hobbies. In particular, since I am a swimmer I want an area full of swimming pools in particular. \n",
    "Then since I love to practice sport in general, I want to live in an area full of gyms and parks where to run and do jogging. A different person who loves arts and exhibitions could prefer an area full of theaters or cinemas for example. \n",
    "Other people could like instead going and chilling out in the evening so an area full of pubs and clubs would be perfect for them. \n",
    "So my problem is in general: find the better place where to live depending on the hobbies and interests of a person."

    "Next, I will explore with the Foursquare API the different venues for each postal code paying particular attention to the gyms, swimming pools, parks and at the end I will use K-means to cluster the data and choose the cluster that better fits to my hobbies. \n",

For postal code *20152* which is close to my office as well, swimming pools appear in the second position and in the 6th one. I can also see how in this cluster swimming pools appear in different postal codes. For example for *20128*, *20151* and *20162* pools appear in the second and in the 7th position. For *20136* pools appear in 4th and 6th position. For *20139* pools appear in the 4th and 5th position. For *20141* pools appear in the 5th and 8th position. For *20148* pools apper in the second and third position. For *20149* pools appear in third and 5th position. For *20159* pools appear in the third and 6th position. But there is only one postal code in which pools appear in the first position and in the 5th one: the **20160**. "
